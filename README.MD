# 👋 Howdy, I'm Devanshu (aka SharmaDevanshu089) 👋

A Computer Science student from Madhya Pradesh, India, who got into coding during the great lockdown of 2020 and never looked back. I'm a fast learner, a passionate game developer, and a firm believer in open-source. I specialize in **Rust** and am deeply committed to contributing to open-source projects. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably debugging it... or rage-quitting a Souls-like game.
