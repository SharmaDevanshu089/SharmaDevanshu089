# 👋 Howdy, I'm Devanshu (aka SharmaDevanshu089) 👋

A Computer Science student from Madhya Pradesh, India, who got into coding during the great lockdown of 2020 and never looked back. I'm a fast learner, a passionate game developer, and a firm believer in open-source. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably debugging it... or rage-quitting a Souls-like game.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 🎮 **Fast-Proj**     | It is an in Development Application which fully automates the common repetative tasks students like me do.This will help save a lot of Time. | Learning the Advanced Skills|
| 📝 **Markdown-Story-Engine** | A simple tool that turns branching Markdown files into a playable "Choose Your Own Adventure" game in the browser. | Working on it|
| 🌌 **Procedural Planet Gen** | Messing around with shaders and procedural generation to create unique, explorable planets. So far, I've made 3 planets and 1 that looks suspiciously like a potato. | Its Just Blender Nodes|
| 🧮 **CalCulator** | Just a Basic Calculator program I created while learning Rust. | <a href="https://github.com/SharmaDevanshu089/CalCulator">Click Here</a>|
| 📐 **Basic Area Shape Calculator** | A Program which Calculates the area of a Shape when Given Values.I tried Proper Error handling here . | <a href="https://github.com/SharmaDevanshu089/_ShapeAreaCalculatulatolator">Click Here</a>|

## 💼 My Skill Tree

Think of this as my character sheet. I've been grinding these skills for a while now.

### ⚔️ Languages in my Arsenal

- **Rust**: My current obsession; building fast, safe, and reliable software.
- **C++**: For when I need speed and control (mostly for game dev).
- **Python**: My go-to for scripting, automation, and when I'm feeling lazy.
- **JavaScript**: Building things for the web and realizing I need another framework.
- **GDScript**: For whipping up prototypes in the awesome Godot Engine.
- **C#**: Exploring the Unity side of the gaming world.
- **PHP**: Back when i thought it was cool.
- **Bootstrap**: I hate declaring classes.
- **Java**: Back in 2020 it was goto lang.
- **Bash**: I use Arch ,btw.

### 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks in my Inventory

- **Git & GitHub**: I commit more often than I commit to my New Year's resolutions.
- **Unity**: For when I'm feeling a bit more mainstream.
- **Neo Vim**: The one true editor (fight me).
- **Linux**: My preferred environment for getting things done.

### 🌱 I'm Currently Learning...

- Blender 3D , yeah i call that hobby.
- Advanced Programming in Rust like Fully End User GUI Applications.
- How to write better documentation so my future self doesn't get angry at my past self.
