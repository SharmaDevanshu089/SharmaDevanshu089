# 👋 Howdy, I'm Devanshu (aka emotionl-push) 👋

A Computer Science student from Madhya Pradesh, India, who got into coding during the great lockdown of 2020 and never looked back. I'm a fast learner, a passionate game developer, and a firm believer in open-source. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably debugging it... or rage-quitting a Souls-like game.

## 🚀 My Projects

Here are a few things I've been tinkering with. Feel free to check them out, break them, and maybe even contribute!

| Project Name            | Description                                                                 | Link         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 🎮 **Retro-Rumble**     | A 2D pixel-art brawler game engine built from scratch in C++. It's all about nostalgia and button-mashing! | Working on it |
| 🤖 **Open-Collab-Bot**  | A Discord bot to help open-source communities manage contributions, assign issues, and celebrate pull requests. | Working on it|
| 📝 **Markdown-Story-Engine** | A simple tool that turns branching Markdown files into a playable "Choose Your Own Adventure" game in the browser. | Working on it|
| 🌌 **Procedural Planet Gen** | Messing around with shaders and procedural generation to create unique, explorable planets. So far, I've made 3 planets and 1 that looks suspiciously like a potato. | Its Just Blender Nodes|

## 💼 My Skill Tree

Think of this as my character sheet. I've been grinding these skills for a while now.

### ⚔️ Languages in my Arsenal

- **C++**: For when I need speed and control (mostly for game dev).
- **Python**: My go-to for scripting, automation, and when I'm feeling lazy.
- **JavaScript**: Building things for the web and realizing I need another framework.
- **GDScript**: For whipping up prototypes in the awesome Godot Engine.
- **C#**: Exploring the Unity side of the gaming world.

### 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks in my Inventory

- **Git & GitHub**: I commit more often than I commit to my New Year's resolutions.
- **Godot Engine**: My beloved open-source game engine.
- **Unity**: For when I'm feeling a bit more mainstream.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The one true editor (fight me).
- **Linux**: My preferred environment for getting things done.

### 🌱 I'm Currently Learning...

- Advanced Graphics Programming with OpenGL/Vulkan (Send help and math tutors).
- Rust, because I heard it's what all the cool kids are using.
- How to write better documentation so my future self doesn't get angry at my past self.
