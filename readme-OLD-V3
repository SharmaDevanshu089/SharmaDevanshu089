👋 Howdy, I'm Devanshu (aka emotionl-push) 👋
The TL;DR on Me
A passionate software developer and Computer Science student with a love for game development and open-source solutions. I'm a Computer Science student from the heart of India (Madhya Pradesh!), and my coding journey began in 7th grade. You know, back in the great year of 2020, when everyone was baking banana bread, I was baking my first "Hello World" program. What started as a way to escape endless online classes turned into a full-blown passion. They say I'm a FAST LEARNER, which is mostly true... unless you count remembering to water my plants.

I'm a huge GAME ENTHUSIAST—I've spent as much time debugging my own code as I have rage-quitting Souls-like games. I believe in the power of community, which is why I'm a passionate supporter of OPEN SOURCE development. If my code can help someone, I'm all for it (plus, the GNU license makes me feel like a digital freedom fighter).

🌌 Procedural Planet Gen

Messing around with shaders and procedural generation to create unique, explorable planets. So far, I've made 3 planets and 1 that looks suspiciously like a potato.

💼 The Recruiter's Corner: My Skill Tree
Think of this as my character sheet. I've been grinding these skills for a while now.

⚔️ Languages in my Arsenal
C++: For when I need speed and control (mostly for game dev).

Python: My go-to for scripting, automation, and when I'm feeling lazy.

JavaScript: Building things for the web and realizing I need another framework.

GDScript: For whipping up prototypes in the awesome Godot Engine.

C#: Exploring the Unity side of the gaming world.

🛠️ Tools & Frameworks in my Inventory
Git & GitHub: I commit more often than I commit to my New Year's resolutions.

Godot Engine: My beloved open-source game engine.

Unity: For when I'm feeling a bit more mainstream.

Visual Studio Code: The one true editor (fight me).

Linux: My preferred environment for getting things done.

🌱 I'm Currently Learning...
Advanced Graphics Programming (Send help and math tutors).

Rust, because I heard it's what all the cool kids are using.

How to write better documentation so my future self doesn't get angry at my past self.

📫 Let's Connect!
I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting projects, especially in game development (love a good game jam!) or building open-source tools. If you have an idea or just want to talk tech, feel free to reach out!
